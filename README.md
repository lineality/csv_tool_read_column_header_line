# csv_tool_read_column_header_line

# df_head.py

This is a python script that reads 
the first line of .csv files.
e.g. 
df_head.py mimics the pandas operation: df.head()

## Instruction Steps:

#### Step 1. 
- Put df_head.py file into a folder 
with your .csv file(s)

#### Step 2. 
- open a terminal and type (and hit return): 
```
python3 df_head.py
```

## No Python Environment or Installs Needed
This script uses only vanilla python and so
should not require any additional environments,
libraries, packages or set up. Just run in a folder 
along with the .csv files.

This method should work for larger files 
(hundreds of megs or a few gigs in size)  
on any computer or device where you can run 
a python script.

## Zipped Archived Handled
if .csv files are in a zipped archive, the function will
automatically find and unzip the archive and then handle each file.
